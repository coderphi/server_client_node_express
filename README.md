# Server-Client Communication in Node.js Express

This repository contains a simple implementation of server-client communication using Node.js with Express, a minimalist web framework for Node.js. The server accepts POST requests with commands, executes them, and returns the result to the client.

## Server

### Description
The server is implemented using Express, a web framework for Node.js. It exposes a single endpoint `/api/command` to receive POST requests containing commands to execute. Upon receiving a command, the server executes it using the `child_process` module, captures the output, and returns it as a JSON response.

### Setup
1. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-express-server-client.git
   cd node-express-server-client/server
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Run the server:npm start

## Client
Description
The client is a simple script that sends POST requests to the server with commands to execute. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests to the server.

Setup
Clone the repository (if not already cloned):
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-express-server-client.git
cd node-express-server-client/client
